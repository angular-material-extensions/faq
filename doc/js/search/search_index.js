The exact method will be slightly\ndifferent for the root (top-level) module for which you should end up with the code similar to (notice MatFaqModule .forRoot()):\nimport { MatFaqModule } from '@angular-material-extensions/faq';\n\n@NgModule({\n  declarations: [AppComponent, ...],\n  imports: [MatFaqModule.forRoot(), ...],  \n  bootstrap: [AppComponent]\n})\nexport class AppModule {\n}Other modules in your application can simply import MatFaqModule:\nimport { MatFaqModule } from '@angular-material-extensions/faq';\n\n@NgModule({\n  declarations: [OtherComponent, ...],\n  imports: [MatFaqModule, ...], \n})\nexport class OtherModule {\n}\nUsage\nangular-material-extensions\nadd the mat-faq or the mat-faq-admin element to your template:\nmat-material-faq\nThis component aims to list the provided frequently asked questions\n\n  \n\n\nimport {Component, OnInit, ViewEncapsulation} from '@angular/core';\nimport {FaqItem} from '@angular-material-extensions/faq';\n\nexport class HomeComponent implements OnInit {\n\n    ngOnInit() {\n    }\n\n  list: FaqItem[] = [\n    {\n          question: 'Why does it think the jQuery plugin is missing?',\n          answer: 'Remember: load jQuery before AngularJS if you are using jQuery plugins!'\n        },\n        {\n          question: 'How do I access the DOM from a controller?',\n          answer: 'DO NOT perform DOM selection/traversal from the controller.
